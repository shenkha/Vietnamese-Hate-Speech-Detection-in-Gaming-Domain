# Vietnamese-Hate-Speech-Detection-in-Gaming-Domain
- This is the final project of my CS114 course at UIT.
- I put all my code and paper here.
- We did crawl comments on Youtube to create our own dataset, then we fine-tuned SOTA models on that dataset.
- The dataset is not recommended to use on any purpose as classes were heavily imbalance.
- UPDATE: XLM-R may outperform other mentioned methods in the paper and achieve the highest result in our dataset.
